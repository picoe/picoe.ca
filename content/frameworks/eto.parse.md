A recursive descent LL(k) parser framework for .NET.

Eto.Parse is a highly optimized recursive decent parser framework that can be used to create parsers for context-free grammars that go beyond the capability of regular expressions.

You can use BNF, EBNF, or Gold Meta-Language grammars to define your parser, code them directly using a Fluent API, or use shorthand operators (or a mix of each).
